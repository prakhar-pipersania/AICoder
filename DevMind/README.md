# Documentation

## Requirements
- .NET 8.0 runtime / SDK.
- Project must run as a console-style worker that orchestrates multi-agent LLM workflows (Enhancer, Planner, CodeGen, Docs).
- Workspace sandbox enforced for file operations (no path traversal, allowed/excluded extensions and directories).
- Resilient HTTP calls for LLM providers (retry policy with exponential backoff).
- Configurable LLM agents via appsettings.json (per-agent Provider, Model, ApiKeyEnv, SystemPrompt, Url).
- Local development fallback to a mock LLM when no API key is set.
- Persist generated files into the workspace and update README.md (except: orchestrator must never perform operations on README.md according to Planner rules â€” note Planner also enforces this).
- Logging and observability via Serilog.
- New/updated requirements in this snapshot:
  - Workspace files should be enumerated and optionally included as context to the LLM pipeline.
  - Agents pipeline order: Enhance -> Plan -> CodeGen -> Docs. Planner output drives which files are created/updated/deleted.
  - FileService must resolve and sanitize paths, and provide file context aggregation for LLM consumption.

  - Key flow:
    - Optionally collects file context via FileService.
    - Enhances requirements via EnhancerAgent if requested.
    - Loads existing docs via DocsAgent and runs the PlannerAgent to get PlanResult.
    - Decides which files to include for CodeGen based on plan (create/update).
    - Runs CodeGenAgent to obtain generated file contents (dictionary path->content) and persists them using FileService.
    - Deletes files as per planner decision using FileService.

    - Logs retry attempts to console.
  - Role: Resilience foundation for provider HTTP clients (Azure/Gemini).

- Services/Utility.cs
  - Purpose: Helpers for sanitizing LLM raw responses and serializing objects.
  - Key methods:
    - Sanitize<T>(string raw): extracts first JSON object in a string and deserializes it using Newtonsoft.Json; returns default on failure.

## Dependencies
- .NET: TargetFramework net8.0
- NuGet packages (from DevMind.csproj):
  - Serilog.AspNetCore (9.0.0)
  - Serilog.Sinks.Console (6.0.0)
  - Polly (8.6.4)
  - Polly.Extensions.Http (3.0.0)
  - Newtonsoft.Json (13.0.4)
- Runtime configuration:
  - appsettings.json required with LLM section (DefaultProvider and Agents settings).

  - Added/updated Services: FileService.cs, HttpBaseClient.cs, Utility.cs.
  - Added/updated DevMindWorker.cs.
- Deletions: No deleted files detected in this snapshot.
- Notes on changes:
  - The orchestrator pipeline implements an end-to-end flow that now persists generated files and updates README.md (DocsAgent). The Planner enforces not to operate on README.md; maintainers should ensure planner rules are respected by LLM prompts and validation.
  - FileService Resolve now normalizes and validates paths to ensure operations remain inside the workspace root.
  - LLMProvider returns mock responses when API keys are not present to allow safe local development; real deployments must set per-agent ApiKeyEnv environment variables and appropriate Url/Model values in appsettings.json.
