AI Coding Assistant Ready!

Enter requirements (or 'exit'): create a webiste to showcase 10 mini games, and when user clicks on a game tile then it should open that game. The games are easy ones like tic-tac-toe, snakes and ladder, etc.
Enhanced requirement: Develop a responsive website featuring a visually appealing landing page that showcases a curated selection of ten distinct, easy-to-learn mini-games. Each game will be represented by an interactive tile. Upon user interaction (click or tap) with a game tile, the selected mini-game should seamlessly launch within the website, providing an engaging and accessible gaming experience. The initial set of games will include classics such as Tic-Tac-Toe and Snakes and Ladders, with potential for future expansion. The website architecture should prioritize intuitive navigation and a user-friendly interface suitable for a broad audience.
